telepathy-glib 0.9.2 (2009-12-03)
=================================

The "old-fashioned, with no silly mods" release.

Dependencies:

* dbus-glib (>= 0.82) is now required

Enhancements:

* Add tp_value_array_build utility function (sjoerd)

* Add tp_g_signal_connect_object, a non-leaky version of
  g_signal_connect_object (alsuren)

* fd.o #25283: add constants for namespaced D-Bus property names,
  such as TP_PROP_CHANNEL_CHANNEL_TYPE (smcv)

* fd.o #25235: add <telepathy-glib/telepathy-glib.h> which includes
  the most commonly-used headers (danni)

Fixes:

* fd.o #24257: make sure tp_account_prepare, tp_account_manager_prepare
  will fail if the object is invalidated, rather than never finishing
  (alsuren)

* fd.o #25051: fix a use-after-free in TpAccountManager by disconnecting
  signal handlers on destruction (alsuren)

* fd.o #24654: fix a potential use-after-free in TpAccount and TpAccountManager
  by copying the list of features required (alsuren)

* Future-proof TpAccount and TpAccountManager to allow more than one Feature
  (alsuren)

* fd.o #24394: improve code portability to Windows headers and compilers,
  based on patches from Matti Reijonen (smcv)

* fd.o #25121: fix failure to link when -Wl,--no-add-needed is used, which is
  the (faster) default behaviour for binutils-gold (Debian #556486) (smcv)

* Fix various coverity nits, including a missing call to va_end,
  and a typo in the documentation (smcv)

* fd.o #25359: alter code generation to cope with arbitrary UTF-8 in the
  spec (wjt)

* fd.o #25335: glib-client-gen: annotate deprecated D-Bus methods (jonny)

* Don't rely on enum types being unsigned (sjoerd)

* fd.o #25181: avoid unnecessary D-Bus calls re-fetching existing TpContact
  objects (alsuren)

* fd.o #25384: if accounts fail to prepare while the account manager is
  preparing, drop them from the list of valid accounts rather than
  never terminating (alsuren)

* If the fake AccountManager doesn't appear for some reason during AM
  regression tests, don't start the system implementation (alsuren)

* Fix a theoretical reference-leak in TpAccountManager, and some memory
  leaks in examples and regression tests (smcv)

telepathy-glib 0.9.1 (2009-10-15)
=================================

The "to quote Rob: sdflkaytliahdskljfhgaqgh;shf" release.

Fixes:

* Corrected the GLib dependency to 2.20 (this was also needed for 0.9.0,
  but that fact was undocumented) (smcv)

* Corrected the error message given when a write-only D-Bus property
  is read (Pekka Pessi)

* Work around GLib 2.20 being less const-correct than 2.22 (jonny)

* fd.o #23853: if a connection manager is discovered not to be running while
  TpConnectionManager has a ListProtocols call in-flight, then a new instance
  of the CM starts up and replies to that call, don't crash with an assertion
  failure (smcv)

* If a connection manager returns error from GetParameters(), don't dereference
  a NULL pointer and segfault (smcv)

* When asked to activate or introspect a connection manager, don't do anything
  until we have at least worked out whether it was initially running, in order
  to provide the documented behaviour (smcv)

* When getting parameter details from a running connection manager, consider
  parameters called "password" or ending with "-password" to be secret even
  if they lack the SECRET flag, as was already done when reading .manager
  files (smcv)

telepathy-glib 0.9.0 (2009-09-28)
=================================

The "purging all the lies" release.

Dependencies:

* GLib 2.20 is now required.
* telepathy-glib now links to GIO as well as GLib and GObject (in practice
  they're packaged together, and we already depended on a new enough GLib
  version that it would come with GIO).

Enhancements:

* TpAccountManager, TpAccount: add convenience API similar to libempathy's
  (jonny, with contributions from wjt/danni/sjoerd/smcv)

* telepathy-glib now uses Automake 1.11's "silent rules" feature for
  kernel-style output; as a result, we no longer use shave. If you were
  previously using --enable-shave to get prettier output, use
  --enable-silent-rules instead, and upgrade to Automake >= 1.11 if you will
  be altering the build system. (jonny)

telepathy-glib 0.8.0 (2009-09-24)
=================================

The "line in the sand" release.

This release begins a bugfix-only 0.8.x branch, in which new API/ABI will no
longer be added; 0.9.x development releases will continue to be made from
the master branch.

Summary of API changes since 0.6.x:

* Since 0.7.35, it is no longer guaranteed that the self-handle in
  TpBaseConnection is set to 0 when the state changes to DISCONNECTED;
  instead, it remains valid until the connection is disposed. This will cause
  assertion failures during disconnection in telepathy-sofiasip < 0.5.17 and
  telepathy-gabble < 0.7.9.

Summary of major enhancements since 0.6.x:

* updated telepathy-spec from 0.16.x to 0.18.0, with many new interfaces, the
  AccountManager, the ChannelDispatcher, and Clients
* added TpProxy, a base class representing remote D-Bus objects
  (see <http://smcv.pseudorandom.co.uk/2009/05/tp-proxy/>)
* added subclasses of TpProxy for all the major Telepathy objects (apart from
  Debug, which will be added later)
* added TpContact, an object representing a Telepathy contact
* added macros for interface-name GQuarks, and for Telepathy dbus-glib GTypes
* added the tp_asv_get_foo() family of functions to manipulate a{sv} maps
* used versioned symbols to document the ABI
* implemented various simple example connection managers and clients

Changes since 0.7.37:

* spec: update from 0.17.28 to 0.18.0 (no real changes) (smcv)
* ContactList example CM: fix a crash during shutdown (andrunko)
* StreamedMedia example CM: check for direction changes correctly (andrunko)
