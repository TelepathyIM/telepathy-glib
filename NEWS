telepathy-glib 0.7.4 (unreleased)
=================================

Enhancements:

Fixes:

* Refactoring and life-cycle fixes in TpProxy, including some assertions
  during method-call and signal-connection cancellation (fd.o #14750; fixes a
  crash in development versions of Mission Control)

* Maps "_" back to "-" in protocol names seen in bus names (fd.o #14667;
  fixes telepathy-inspector 0.5.1 not displaying Salut connections)

* Does not leak the GError when connecting to signals on an unsupported
  interface (fd.o #14746)

* Builds with more warnings by default, for additional strictness

* Improvements to example client code:
  - make example_cli_init() safe to call multiple times
  - generate signals-marshal.list in a way that avoids more gcc warnings

Recommended updates for projects using telepathy-glib code generation:

* Update glib-client-gen.py from telepathy-glib to fix #14746 (this will make
  the generated code require telepathy-glib 0.7.3)
* Consider updating *_cli_init() and extensions/Makefile.am to resemble the
  examples

telepathy-glib 0.7.3 (2008-02-20)
=================================

Requirements:

* pkg-config 0.21 is now required

* gtkdoc 1.8 is recommended

Enhancements:

* Supports org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties with a mixin for services, and
  extensions to auto-generated code

Fixes:

* Fixed a crash that could occur when pending calls on otherwise unreferenced
  proxies are cancelled, e.g. during teardown in telepathy-stream-engine
  (fd.o #14576)

* Correct client-side bindings are generated for methods that return a variant
  (e.g. o.fd.DBus.Properties.Get) fixing potential crashes in clients

* tp_dbus_check_valid_object_path allows "/" and disallows "//", not the
  reverse

* Partially works around some gtkdoc 1.7 bugs (if your gtkdoc is 1.7 you'll
  still lose the "Telepathy protocol enumerations" section)

* Uses pkg-config's Requires.private feature to reduce shared library
  interdependencies

telepathy-glib 0.7.2 (2008-02-11)
=================================

* Fixed incorrect GValue code that caused Empathy to assert on
  Room -> Join New...

* Added support for the D-Bus core Properties, Introspect and Peer interfaces

telepathy-glib 0.7.1 (2008-01-04)
=================================

This is a major feature release, adding client-side code which continues the
process of making libtelepathy obsolete.

* Implements specification 0.17.1
  - it is a fatal error for TpBaseConnectionManagerClass::cm_dbus_name not to
    conform to the specification (briefly: it must match
    /[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]+/)
  - connections cannot be opened for protocols not matching
    /[A-Za-z-][A-Za-z0-9-]+/

* Initial client-side code added:
  - TpProxy, a much more capable version of DBusGProxy (it more closely
    resembles a dbus-python ProxyObject, with one object per connection,
    channel etc. rather than one per interface)
  - auto-generation machinery for client call wrappers (namespaced tp_cli_*)
  - TpDBusDaemon, a TpProxy subclass to talk to the bus daemon
  - TpChannel, a channel (replaces libtelepathy's TpChan)
  - TpConnection, a connection (replaces libtelepathy's TpConn)
  - TpConnectionManager, a connection manager (replaces libtelepathy's
    TpConnMgr)
  - TpMediaStreamHandler and TpMediaSessionHandler, media signalling helpers
  - Correct algorithms for listing connection managers, listing connections,
    and reading .manager files (as documented in the 0.17.1 spec)

* Examples extended:
  - various simple client examples
  - an "echo" connection manager
  - an extended connection manager and client (implementing a hypothetical
    Hats interface), to illustrate how to support experimental or extension
    interfaces in services and clients

* Miscellaneous:
  - tp_debug_divert_messages (adapted from Gabble)
  - tp_debug_timestamped_log_handler (adapted from Gabble)
  - tp_cm_param_setter_offset now supports byte-array params

* Versioned symbols
  - versions are of the form TELEPATHY_GLIB_x.y.z
  - unreleased development builds use versions containing _UNRELEASED
    to force relinking against a proper version

telepathy-glib 0.7.0 (2007-11-22)
=================================

This is the first release from the 0.7.0 development branch, and
prepares the way for the client-side code I'm going to be merging soon.

* Enums etc. updated to specification 0.17.0
* Improved support for connection managers whose parameters aren't known
  at compile time (*coughhazecough* :-)
* Build system refactoring to make it less weird
* GType-generating functions and macros in gtypes.h cache the results of calls
  to dbus-glib type lookup functions, and give data types convenient names
* Functions and macros to generate GQuarks for interface names (which will
  be used extensively by client code in future)
* The beginning of an examples/ directory, containing the simplest possible
  example connection manager (it doesn't support any protocols)
* Dependencies increased to libdbus 0.93, dbus-glib 0.73, glib 2.10
