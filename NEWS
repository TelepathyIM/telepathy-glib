telepathy-glib 0.6.2 (2008-02-05)
=================================

The "backporting is scary" release.

Debugging enhancements:

* log a warning when a CM is disconnected from the session bus (backported from
  0.7.7)

* When doing handle-leak debugging, print a message when there are no leaks,
  so you can tell the check has been done (backported from 0.7.7)

* TpBaseConnection: assert that all pure-virtual functions are implemented in
  subclasses (backported from 0.7.1)

Fixes:

* TpBaseConnection: don't return from Disconnect() until disconnection has
  fully completed (fd.o #15796, backported from 0.7.7)

* TpDynamicHandleRepo: in tp_handle_lookup() implementation, raise
  NotAvailable if the ID is valid but there is no handle, rather than
  returning 0 with no error (fd.o #15387, backported from 0.7.7)

* TpTextMixin: ListPendingMessages: don't leak the GValueArrays and their
  contents (backported from 0.7.7)

* TpGroupMixin: silently map NULL message to "" rather than crashing
  (backported from 0.7.1)

* TpPresenceMixin: don't crash when RemoveStatus is called (backported from
  0.7.1)
