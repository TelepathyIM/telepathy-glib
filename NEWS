telepathy-glib 0.8.1 (2009-10-15)
=================================

The "TpConnectionManager was not my finest hour" release.

Fixes:

* fd.o #23853: if a connection manager is discovered not to be running while
  TpConnectionManager has a ListProtocols call in-flight, then a new instance
  of the CM starts up and replies to that call, don't crash with an assertion
  failure (smcv)

* If a connection manager returns error from GetParameters(), don't dereference
  a NULL pointer and segfault (smcv)

* When asked to activate or introspect a connection manager, don't do anything
  until we have at least worked out whether it was initially running, in order
  to provide the documented behaviour (smcv)

* When getting parameter details from a running connection manager, consider
  parameters called "password" or ending with "-password" to be secret even
  if they lack the SECRET flag, as was already done when reading .manager
  files (smcv)

* Corrected the error message given when a write-only D-Bus property
  is read (Pekka Pessi)

telepathy-glib 0.8.0 (2009-09-24)
=================================

The "line in the sand" release.

This release begins a bugfix-only 0.8.x branch, in which new API/ABI will no
longer be added; 0.9.x development releases will continue to be made from
the master branch.

Summary of API changes since 0.6.x:

* Since 0.7.35, it is no longer guaranteed that the self-handle in
  TpBaseConnection is set to 0 when the state changes to DISCONNECTED;
  instead, it remains valid until the connection is disposed. This will cause
  assertion failures during disconnection in telepathy-sofiasip < 0.5.17 and
  telepathy-gabble < 0.7.9.

Summary of major enhancements since 0.6.x:

* updated telepathy-spec from 0.16.x to 0.18.0, with many new interfaces, the
  AccountManager, the ChannelDispatcher, and Clients
* added TpProxy, a base class representing remote D-Bus objects
  (see <http://smcv.pseudorandom.co.uk/2009/05/tp-proxy/>)
* added subclasses of TpProxy for all the major Telepathy objects (apart from
  Debug, which will be added later)
* added TpContact, an object representing a Telepathy contact
* added macros for interface-name GQuarks, and for Telepathy dbus-glib GTypes
* added the tp_asv_get_foo() family of functions to manipulate a{sv} maps
* used versioned symbols to document the ABI
* implemented various simple example connection managers and clients

Changes since 0.7.37:

* spec: update from 0.17.28 to 0.18.0 (no real changes) (smcv)
* ContactList example CM: fix a crash during shutdown (andrunko)
* StreamedMedia example CM: check for direction changes correctly (andrunko)

telepathy-glib 0.7.37 (2009-09-14)
==================================

The "Lego Batman" release.

Enhancements:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.28
  * add ContactCapabilities interface
  * add InitialVideo, InitialAudio, ImmutableStreams properties to
    StreamedMedia
  * add TP_CHANNEL_CALL_STATE_FLAG_IN_PROGRESS

* Set the debug domain for telepathy-glib to tp-glib/$category, e.g.
  tp-glib/connection for TpConnection and TpBaseConnection (jonny)

Fixes:

* fd.o #23843: make tp_debug_sender_log_handler with exclude=NULL include
  everything, rather than nothing (smcv)

telepathy-glib 0.7.36 (2009-09-03)
==================================

The "yes, it's a phone" release.

Enhancements:

* Add TpDebugSender, along with the lower-level TpSvcDebug interface that it
  uses (jonny)

* Clarify when tp_proxy_signal_connection_disconnect is safe to call (smcv)

* Add support for simulating DTMF and Hold support in the 'callable' example
  connection manager (andrunko)

* fd.o #21327: truncate the ChangeLog at version 0.6 to stop it being so huge,
  and force ISO date format (wjt)

Fixes:

* If the bus name for a Connection would be too long, hash the unique name
  provided by the CM, instead of crashing (daf)

* fd.o #23524: don't introspect a TpConnectionManager twice in parallel,
  avoiding an assertion failure (wjt)

* TpChannel: don't disconnect from a TpProxySignalConnection that's already
  gone, fixing a crash (smcv)

* tp_connection_manager_idle_read_manager_file: avoid using the
  TpConnectionManager after it may have been disposed (sjoerd)

* TpBaseConnection: Allow GetInterfaces() to succeed before CONNECTED (smcv)

telepathy-glib 0.7.35 (2009-08-18)
==================================

The "dance to the sound of sirens" release.

API changes:

* fd.o #17751: TpBaseConnection no longer guarantees that the self-handle is
  set to 0 when the state changes to DISCONNECTED; instead, the self-handle
  remains valid until the connection is disposed, so that connection managers
  can use it during teardown. (cassidy)
  - This change will cause assertion failures on disconnection in
    telepathy-sofiasip older than 0.5.17, and in telepathy-gabble older than
    0.7.9.

Enhancements:

* Add tp_dbus_daemon_list_names() and tp_dbus_daemon_list_activatable_names(),
  which are more efficient (and more const-correct) versions of the
  corresponding autogenerated tp_cli_dbus_daemon methods (smcv)

* Support the Hold interface in the "callable" example CM (andrunko)

Fixes:

* Finally make tp_dbus_daemon_watch_name_owner bind to NameOwnerChanged
  selectively, for reduced wakeups. To take advantage of this, you should
  avoid using all functions that start with tp_cli_dbus_daemon_; file bugs
  to request more replacement functions in the tp_dbus_daemon namespace. (smcv)

* Fix a memory leak in tp_dbus_daemon_watch_name_owner (smcv)

* fd.o #9812: TpDynamicHandleRepo: use tp_dbus_daemon_watch_name_owner for
  reduced wakeups (smcv)

* In TpDynamicHandleRepo, if a client holds handles then immediately crashes,
  release those handles as soon as we find out that it's gone (smcv)

* fd.o #22957: fix compilation in some non-gcc compilers
  (based on a patch from Elaine Xiong)

* As per telepathy-spec 0.17.27, represent connection status reason NAME_IN_USE
  as TP_ERROR_CONNECTION_REPLACED or TP_ERROR_ALREADY_CONNECTED (as
  appropriate), not as TP_ERROR_NOT_YOURS, so that NotYours can safely be given
  special handling (smcv)

telepathy-glib 0.7.34 (2009-08-16)
==================================

The "secret lack of example detected" release.

Enhancements:

* Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.27 (smcv)
  - generate code for Connection.Interface.Location
  - omit Debug interface from code-generation for now: it will be enabled in a
    future release when we have reference client- and service-side
    implementations (possibly called TpDebugReceiver and TpDebugSender)
  - add more errors
  - generate code for Handler.Capabilities property

* Add macros for static assertions (tp_verify, tp_verify_true,
  tp_verify_statement) to util.h (smcv, adapted from gnulib)

* Make the allocation model for tp_dbus_properties_mixin_make_properties_hash
  part of our ABI guarantee (smcv)

* Add a GType macro TP_ARRAY_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH_LIST (wjt)

Fixes:

* fd.o #23164: don't unref a NULL DBusMessage (wjt)

* Get tp_intset_iter_init and tp_intset_iter_reset into the documentation (smcv)

* Make omitted CM parameters that have a default indistinguishable from
  explicitly-passed parameters with that value, removing the need to specify
  the default in the Connection as well (sjoerd)

* fd.o #22889: reduce introspection round-trips (wjt)

* Fix header guard in debug.h (dilinger)

* fd.o #18091: for interfaces with D-Bus methods, document how to write a
  complete interface init function (smcv)

* Fix a rare crash when a TpProxyPendingCall is cancelled before the
  DBusGProxyCall is provided (smcv)

telepathy-glib 0.7.33 (2009-06-26)
==================================

The "please be careful when handling the sun" release.

Fixes:

* Fixed a test failure in test-params-cm on certain architectures, including
  powerpc and sparc (smcv)

* Fixed an assertion failure in TpConnection if StatusChanged to CONNECTED is
  followed immdiately by GetStatus returning CONNECTED (smcv)

telepathy-glib 0.7.32 (2009-06-12)
==================================

The "cake wars" release.

Enhancements:

* fd.o #22208: Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.26 (smcv)

* Added generated service-side bindings for AccountManager, Account,
  ChannelDispatcher, ChannelDispatchOperation, ChannelRequest and Client (smcv)

* Added minimal versions of TpAccountManager, TpAccount,
  TpChannelDispatcher, TpChannelDispatchOperation, TpChannelRequest and
  TpClient (smcv)

* fd.o #22205: Added support for deprecating or removing _run_ methods in code
  generation (smcv)

* Added flymake support (jonnylamb)

* fd.o #22230: Added support for byte ('y') parameters to CMs (smcv)

Fixes:

* Made sure _gen/error-str.h and .c end with a newline, fixing compilation with
  certain compilers (smcv)

* fd.o #19741: Documented client-side handle reference counting (wjt)

* fd.o #21977: Removed duplicate mention of media-interfaces.h in Makefile.am
  (Patryk Zawadzki)

* fd.o #22121: made tp_channel_dispose properly idempotent (wjt)

* Removed dead code for introspecting alias flags (smcv)

* fd.o #22182: Fixed a potential use-after-free in the callable example CM
  (smcv)

Release notes for projects using code generation:

* After updating to this version of glib-client-gen.py, _run_ methods will no
  longer be generated by default. To get the behaviour of older versions, run
  it with the new --generate-reentrant option; to get the methods present
  but deprecated, use an option like
  --deprecate-reentrant=FOO_DISABLE_DEPRECATED (which means the _run_ methods
  are marked with G_GNUC_DEPRECATED, and will not be available at all if
  FOO_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is defined).

telepathy-glib 0.7.31 (2009-05-27)
==================================

The "this beer tastes of Stilton!" release.

Enhancements:

* Added TP_ERROR_STR_* constants corresponding to the members of the
  TpError enum, and tp_error_get_dbus_name() mapping the latter to the
  former (cassidy/wjt)

* Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.25, adding ConnectionRefused, ConnectionFailed
  and ConnectionLost errors, and the new-style StreamTube and DBusTube channel
  types (cassidy)

* Made tp_g_key_file_get_int64 and _uint64 into public API for Mission
  Control's benefit (smcv)

Fixes:

* Changed the dbus_daemon member of TpProxy to be removed in dispose, rather
  than just after the invalidated signal (smcv)

* Fixed a null pointer dereference if a TpConnectionManager is resurrected
  during dispose (smcv)

* Fixed a use-after-free when the user-supplied object in
  tp_connection_manager_call_when_ready is destroyed after the CM becomes
  ready (smcv)

* Fixed tp_dbus_daemon_request_name, tp_dbus_daemon_release_name and
  _tp_dbus_daemon_get_name_owner to fail gracefully if the TpDBusDaemon has
  been invalidated (smcv)

telepathy-glib 0.7.30 (2009-05-18)
==================================

The "slowing down but with a sense of speeding up" release.

API changes:

* tp_proxy_add_interface_by_id() may not be called on an invalidated proxy. (It
  never made sense to do this, but now telepathy-glib will complain if you do.)

Enhancements:

* Added tp_dbus_daemon_request_name() and tp_dbus_daemon_release_name(). (Fixes
  fd.o#21771.)

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.23, adding the Terminated error.

* Added optional support for Shave, to give kernel-style pretty make output.
  (This is disabled by default; to enable it, pass --enable-shave to configure.)
  (Jonny Lamb)

* Channel introspection will now fail more quickly when the channel is
  invalidated.

Fixes:

* Generated GInterfaces now install type information sooner, fixing a bug where
  object construction could make dbus-glib assert. (Ross Burton)

* fd.o#21792: tp_presence_mixin_simple_presence_fill_contact_attributes asserts
  if get_contact_statuses returns NULL.

telepathy-glib 0.7.29 (2009-04-03)
==================================

The "sense of adventure working perfectly and sensing no adventures" release.

Enhancements:

* TpBaseConnectionManager, tp_cm_param_setter_offset: support parameters of
  various extra types - object path, double, 64-bit signed and unsigned
  integer, array of strings, array of bytes - and add regression tests

* TpContact: enhance documentation to spell out that change notification is
  via GObject::notify::alias etc.

* tp_asv_new(), a shorthand for creating hash tables from strings to
  slice-allocated GValues, along with tp_asv_set_* and tp_asv_take_* helpers to
  add entries to such hash tables. (Fixes fd.o#20942)

telepathy-glib 0.7.28 (2009-03-24)
==================================

The "a surprisingly meaty courgette" release.

API changes:

* Use the prefix for D-Bus errors specified by telepathy-spec, not something
  telepathy-glib made up (changing .Errors to the correct .Error). This was
  a regression in telepathy-glib 0.7.1.

  Expected impact of this change:
  * Connection managers will emit the correct errors as soon as the
    telepathy-glib shared library is upgraded
  * Clients that use TpConnection, TpChannel etc. will expect the correct
    errors as soon as the shared library is upgraded
  * Clients that match errors by string value using TP_ERROR_PREFIX will have
    to be recompiled against the new telepathy-glib, but should have sane
    fallback behaviour to treat the correct error strings as an unknown error

Enhancements:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.22, adding
  TP_ARRAY_TYPE_SOCKET_ADDRESS_IP_LIST, TP_ARRAY_TYPE_STRING_STRING_MAP_LIST,
  TP_STRUCT_TYPE_SOCKET_ADDRESS_IP

* Extend the 'callable' example connection manager to support simulated
  incoming calls, support simulated contacts who never answer, are busy or
  terminate the call, and comply with telepathy-spec 0.17.22

Fixes:

* fd.o #20729: csh (chatroom) example connection manager: comply with
  telepathy-spec 0.17.21 by always allowing the user to leave the Group

* Cancel GetParameters call if the CM crashes, fixing an assertion failure
  in tp_connection_manager_continue_introspection

telepathy-glib 0.7.27 (2009-03-17)
==================================

The "sliced woot" release.

Enhancements:

* fd.o #18220: make it much less verbose to construct string/variant maps
  (a{sv}) by adding functions like tp_g_value_slice_new_uint(), which are a
  shortcut for a sequence like tp_g_value_slice_new (G_TYPE_UINT) followed by
  g_value_set_uint

* Make example connection managers installable (they might be useful for
  testing UIs - use ./configure --enable-installed-examples if you want them)

* Add an example connection manager that has dummy StreamedMedia channels

* Add an example connection manager that has dummy ContactList channels
  vaguely resembling the XMPP roster

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.21 (adding
  TP_CHANNEL_GROUP_FLAG_MESSAGE_DEPART and
  TP_CHANNEL_MEDIA_CAPABILITY_NAT_TRAVERSAL_ICE_UDP)

Fixes:

* fd.o #20646: in TpChannel, when adding contacts to one of the Group sets,
  remove them from both of the others

* Use AM_PATH_PYTHON to detect the Python version

* In TpGroupMixin, let implementations allow the self-handle to be removed
  regardless of whether the CAN_REMOVE flag is set. This is meant to be how
  you remove yourself gracefully from a chatroom or streamed media call.

* fd.o #20165: fix a use-after-free in tp_base_connection_register() that
  causes connection managers to assert if they have not already called
  tp_dbus_daemon_dup() or tp_run_connection_manager() (regression in 0.7.26
  which broke the telepathy-qt4 regression tests)

* Fix some memory leaks when making TpContact objects, when holding handles in
  TpContactsMixin, when filling contact attributes in TpPresenceMixin,
  when setting simple presence, and in the regression tests

* Update the valgrind suppressions file to cope with new telepathy-glib code,
  GTest, and glibc 2.9

* Fix compilation with gtkdoc 1.11, which is stricter about the contents of
  Since: annotations, and parses more comments

telepathy-glib 0.7.26 (2009-02-16)
==================================

The "Leffe Radieuse" release.

Enhancements:

* Add tp_connection_manager_call_when_ready()

* When constructing TpConnectionManager, if the .manager file is missing
  or can't be read, always try to activate the connection manager (in
  practice, this is what's wanted)

* fd.o #18291: when listing connection managers, wait for them to all be ready

* fd.o #18056: add method-based accessors for TpConnectionManager members

* fd.o #17519: track the Connection's SelfHandle property in TpConnection

* Add tp_dbus_daemon_dup(), convenient API to share a starter-bus connection

* Generate GTypes for arrays of mappings, and improve use of the
  type-generation functions

* fd.o #19907: Add tp_intset_new_containing(), a convenient factory for sets
  with exactly one member

Deprecations:

* Deprecate tp_get_bus_proxy()

Fixes:

* Reduce our reliance on making a DBusGProxy for the dbus-daemon (working
  towards avoiding overly-broad NameOwnerChanged matches)

* fd.o #18832 (partially addressed): document that tp_get_bus() can call
  exit() and why, and discourage it in processes that aren't totally reliant
  on D-Bus

* fd.o #18207: reliably emit TpConnectionManager::got-info signal (although
  tp_connection_manager_call_when_ready() should be used instead)

* Fix some assertion failures in TpConnectionManager when .manager files
  contain surprising types

* fd.o #19054: Parse all currently supported types in .manager files

* fd.o #20096: don't consider InvalidHandle to be fatal for
  tp_connection_get_contacts_by_id (spec 0.17.18 compliance)

Miscellaneous:

* Add regression test coverage for TpConnectionManager

telepathy-glib 0.7.25 (2009-01-30)
==================================

The "Paradise Lost" release.

Fixes:

* fd.o #17588: don't break ABI if errors are re-ordered in a future spec
  version

* fd.o #19688: don't assert when getting contacts by ID if none of the
  identifiers supplied are valid

* TpPresenceMixin: don't allow setting statuses that are flagged as not
  settable on the user themselves

* TpPresenceMixin: never allow statuses of type OFFLINE, UNKNOWN or ERROR to
  be set on the user themselves, and warn if the connection manager got this
  wrong

* Fix a memory leak in tp_presence_mixin_get_statuses() (sorry Jonathon,
  your patch got lost during the release process...)

telepathy-glib 0.7.24 (2009-01-28)
==================================

The "Divide By Cucumber Error" release.

API changes:

* When a TpConnection is invalidated due to disconnection, the error will now
  be chosen from the TP_ERRORS domain in most cases. Previously, the
  TP_ERROR_DISCONNECTED domain was used. This change is necessary to support
  the extensible error reporting introduced in spec 0.17.19.

Enhancements:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.19
  - Many new errors in the TP_ERRORS domain
  - Connection.ConnectionError signal for extensible error reporting

* Add a client binding for the extensible error reporting provided
  by the ConnectionError signal

* Use a simple Python implementation of XInclude, rather than xsltproc, for
  easier Windows porting

Fixes:

* Add File Transfer to the documentation

telepathy-glib 0.7.23 (2009-01-20)
==================================

The "new in version 0.7.1, and allegedly also in 0.7.21" release.

Enhancements:

* Updated to spec version 0.17.18
  - Added the File Transfer channel type
  - Added TpRichPresenceAccessControlType and
    TP_STRUCT_TYPE_RICH_PRESENCE_ACCESS_CONTROL
  - RequestHandles raises NotImplemented for bad handle types or InvalidHandle
    for bad identifiers (fd.o #19609)
  - MediaStreamHandler has a CodecsUpdated method
  - Methods automatically generated by telepathy-glib now have names
    for all "out" arguments, which should make the documentation easier to use

* Use tp:name-for-bindings to construct the C name for D-Bus methods etc.,
  which will result in better C function naming for future D-Bus interfaces
  like DBusTube

Fixes:

* Remove symbols from 0.7.21.abi that were already in 0.7.1.abi (GNU ld
  seems to respond by giving them the older version, so no harm was done
  to the ABI, but it broke the Debian packages)

* Make make-version-script.py fail if that ever happens again

* Annotate things added in 0.7.21 with the correct "Since:" indicator

* Correct the documentation for tp_list_connection_names()

telepathy-glib 0.7.22 (2009-01-13)
==================================

The "TP_STRUCT_TYPE_BROWN_PAPER_BAG" release.

Fixes:

* Accept message=NULL in tp_group_mixin_change_members, as documented and true
  in the past, rather than crashing.

telepathy-glib 0.7.21 (2009-01-12)
==================================

The "TP_HASH_TYPE_PINT_HOBGOBLIN_MOUTH_MAP" release.

Enhancements:

* Updated to spec version 0.17.17
  - Added TP_HASH_TYPE_HANDLE_IDENTIFIER_MAP and
    TP_HASH_TYPE_MESSAGE_PART_CONTENT_MAP

* (Finally) merged TpMessageMixin, which can be used in place of TpTextMixin to
  implement the Messages interface on Text channels.

* The examples have been made more exemplary, using TpChannelManager in place
  of TpChannelFactoryIface, implementing Destroyable and respawning 1-1 text
  channels which are closed with pending messages.
  (fd.o #17632)

* Added a TP_COMPILER_WARNINGS macro to simplify choosing compiler warnings in
  configure.ac, and forked a version of AS_COMPILER_FLAG that supports C++ so
  that TP_COMPILER_WARNINGS can be used for C++ projects (such as
  telepathy-qt4).  Other projects using telepathy-glib's warnings might want to
  copy m4/tp-compiler-*.m4 and use TP_COMPILER_WARNINGS.

* Added support to TpGroupMixin for emitting the MembersChangedDetailed signal
  (fd.o #19050 and #19052), and to TpChannel for listening to it when possible
  (fd.o #19051).

* Added tp_channel_get_identifier

* Added support for parsing the dbus-property CM parameter flag (introduced in
  spec 0.17.16) from .manager files (fd.o #19053).

Fixes:

* Various Win32 portability fixes (from Sunil Mohan Adapa on fd.o #19461).

* fd.o #19101: tp_connection_get_contacts_by_id() crashes

telepathy-glib 0.7.20 (2008-12-14)
==================================

The "xfs_freeze stole the night" release.

Enhancements:

* Updated to spec version 0.17.16
  - Generate code for the Messages interface, which is now undrafted.

Fixes:

* fd.o #18845: don't throw a critical error from TpConnection if the
  corresponding CM falls off the bus.

* fd.o #18926: avoid using a non-top-level GLib header

telepathy-glib 0.7.19 (2008-12-01)
==================================

The "fast path" release.

Enhancements:

* TpContact now has a fast path using the Contacts interface to reduce
  D-Bus round-trips, if supported

* tp_connection_get_contact_attributes integrates the Contacts interface
  with TpConnection's handle reference tracking at a lower level

* TpChannel now tracks its immutable properties (as provided by
  Requests.NewChannels, Requests.CreateChannel and Requests.EnsureChannel),
  can be constructed from a dictionary of immutable properties
  (tp_channel_new_from_properties), and has a fast path using GetAll to reduce
  round trips (if supported); when constructed from a dictionary of immutable
  properties, non-Group channels should become 'ready' in a single round-trip
  (fd.o #17427)

* Only use the Properties mixin in there are properties defined

Fixes:

* fd.o #15092: mixins in a superclass should now work correctly in subclasses

* fd.o #18151: tp_base_connection_dispose asserts if there are two connections to the same account

telepathy-glib 0.7.18 (2008-11-03)
==================================

The "320 GB" release.

Enhancements:

* Update to spec 0.17.14
  * test, and generate code for, the Destroyable interface
  * add support for the SCROLLBACK and RESCUED message flags in Text
  * add tp_text_mixin_set_rescued(), for CMs to call when respawning a channel,
    and tp_text_mixin_receive_with_flags(), for CMs to call when receiving
    scrollback messages
  * update echo example CM's Text support to spec 0.17.14
  * CreateChannel etc. return before NewChannels, which is emitted before
    NewChannel

* Add TpContact, an object representing a contact, with inspection of various
  attributes (e.g. alias, avatar token and SimplePresence)

Fixes:

* In TpContactsMixin, always return info from interface TP_IFACE_CONNECTION
  even if the client didn't ask for it, since the spec says we should

* Add a simple regression test for TpContactsMixin

* Use unsigned int (rather than gboolean, which is signed!) for bitfields

* Fix a memory leak when a TpChannel with the Group interface is freed

* Fix a memory leak in tp_connection_unref_handles when no handles are released

* Fix some memory leaks in the regression tests

* Re-enable the coding style check and fix various things it complained about

telepathy-glib 0.7.17 (2008-10-14)
==================================

The "inexplicable bonus pizza" release.

Enhancements:

* Updated to spec 0.17.13, which adds Requested, InitiatorHandle and
  InitiatorID properties to Channel

* Updated two example CMs (echo and channelspecific) to spec 0.17.13 too

* Added handle reference-counting helpers, which should be used instead
  of using the HoldHandles, RequestHandles and ReleaseHandles D-Bus API
  directly

* Added C accessors for TpProxy's read-only properties, and for
  TpConnection's connection-ready property

* Added some infrastructure for test coverage analysis using lcov

* Moved some of the release/checking machinery to tools/telepathy.am
  for easy pasting into other Telepathy projects

* The first time TP_ERRORS is used, the error domain is now automatically
  registered with dbus-glib

* Added sanity checks (g_return_if_fail/g_critical) to TpConnection,
  TpProxy, TpDBusDaemon and tp_dbus_check_* public API

Fixes:

* tp_handle_is_valid and tp_handles_are_valid raise InvalidHandle on failure,
  not InvalidArgument (numerous methods in telepathy-spec require
  InvalidHandle to be raised, so this should make most CMs more
  spec-compliant)

* The test and example CMs raise NotAvailable on syntactically incorrect
  strings, rather than InvalidArgument (which is not spec-compliant)

* The example valgrind suppressions file now works if libdbus was not
  installed in /usr, or if glibc is version 2.7

* fd.o #17502: fixed documentation of the #include for TpDBusPropertiesMixin

* Fixed a memory leak in TpContactsMixin

telepathy-glib 0.7.16 (2008-09-26)
==================================

The "could you say that again? I was looking at that bee" release.

Dependencies:

* To use --enable-gtk-doc you must now have at least gtkdoc 1.10

Enhancements:

* Updated to spec 0.17.12, mainly featuring EnsureChannel

* We now support EnsureChannel on the Requests interface - to implement this,
  put a suitable function pointer in TpChannelManagerIface::ensure_channel

* Channel factories' RequestChannel implementations no longer need to
  validate handles - TpBaseConnection now does this automatically

* Added a function to compare presence types in order of "availability"

Fixes:

* The gtkdoc now documents GInterfaces' signals and properties (fd.o #16995,
  fd.o #17308)

* TpBaseConnection::self_handle is unreffed and cleared slightly later,
  for the benefit of channel managers that want to use it in their
  status-changed(Disconnected) callback

* Fixed a compiler warning on platforms with daemon(3) in their libc

* TpChannelManager can no longer be crashed by asking for unsupported
  handle types

telepathy-glib 0.7.15 (2008-09-18)
==================================

The "plumbing" release.

Dependencies:

* GLib and GObject must be at least version 2.16 (this was accidentally the
  case in 0.7.14 too, but the dependency is now official). (fd.o #17213)

Deprecations:

* TpBaseConnection implementations should use the new method
  tp_base_connection_set_self_handle instead of setting the self_handle member
  directly. To comply with spec 0.17.10, if the self-handle changes after the
  status becomes CONNECTED, tp_base_connection_set_self_handle *must* be used.

Enhancements:

* Updated to specification 0.17.10, which includes the SelfHandleChanged signal
  and SelfHandle property...

* ... and then to specification 0.17.11, which includes the stable Requests
  interface with the CreateChannel method (but not EnsureChannel, which is
  planned for a future spec.).

* Added support for the Requests interface to TpBaseConnection, using the new
  interfaces TpChannelManager and TpExportableChannel (which are intended to
  replace TpChannelFactoryIface and TpChannelIface).

* Added some utility functions: tp_dbus_properties_mixin_make_properties_hash,
  tp_strv_contains

* with-session-bus.sh (used for the tests) optionally records dbus-monitor
  output

* telepathy-glib-uninstalled.pc is generated in source builds. It's now
  easier to compile dependent projects against an uninstalled copy of
  telepathy-glib >= 0.7.15, like this:

  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/src/telepathy-glib/telepathy-glib ./autogen.sh

  (if $HOME/src/telepathy-glib is the directory containing this file)

Fixes:

* TP_BASE_CONNECTION_ERROR_IF_NOT_CONNECTED no longer causes compiler warnings
  when used from a C++ source file

* glib-client-gen.py generates correct code for 64-bit unsigned integers

Release notes for projects using code generation:

* If you generate client-side code, update glib-client-gen.py to avoid wrong
  code generation for unsigned 64-bit integer arguments. This will cause your
  project to require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.3

* If you use a copy of with-session-bus.sh for regression tests, consider
  updating it to add support for logging dbus-monitor

telepathy-glib 0.7.14 (2008-08-19)
==================================

The "M'era Luna" release.

Enhancements:

* Updated to specification 0.17.9
  - Connection.Interface.Contacts interface ("the inspectotron"), which allows
    mass contact-handle holding and inspection in a single round-trip
  - Channel.TargetID property, for further round-trip reduction

* Added TpContactsMixin, a generic implementation of the Contacts interface

* Moved source code control from darcs to git (see README for details)

* Added tp_connection_get_status() convenience accessor for status and
  status-reason properties

* Altered tp_debug_divert_messages() to support a "+" prefix to filenames,
  which changes the mode from truncate to append: you can now set something
  like GABBLE_LOGFILE="+gabble.log" to append to an existing log

* Updated AUTHORS

telepathy-glib 0.7.13 (2008-07-29)
==================================

The "presence made easy" release.

Enhancements:

* TpPresenceMixin implements the new SimplePresence interface

* The spec text and doc-generator.xsl have been updated

* The coding-style checks have been removed

* A couple of supporting functions for Requests API development have
  been added (tp_text_mixin_has_pending_messages and
  tp_dbus_properties_mixin_get)

Release notes for projects using code generation:

* We now ship the more pedantic doc-generator.xsl from telepathy-spec 0.17.8:
  - you'll probably need to clean up your spec markup!
  - set the allow-undefined-interfaces XSLT parameter to a true value (e.g.
    run xsltproc with --param allow-undefined-interfaces "true()") if you are
    compiling documentation for interfaces that are not self-contained
    (e.g. Telepathy extensions that reference the main Telepathy spec)

* If you're trying to use Telepathy coding style, upgrading the coding-style
  checks is recommended, but might require you to make code changes

telepathy-glib 0.7.12 (2008-07-21)
==================================

The "Channel.Interface.Useful" release.

Enhancements:

* TpChannel and TpConnection can be subclassed (fd.o #14828, #14829)

* TpChannel has various convenience methods like tp_channel_get_channel_type(),
  which can be used as an alternative to its GObject properties

* Internally, TpChannel tries to use D-Bus core Properties (the GetAll
  method) to reduce round-trips; if that fails, it will automatically fall
  back to a series of normal method calls

* TpChannel tracks the Group interface automatically (fd.o #14180)

* tp_asv_size() has been added to the a{sv} convenience API, which now has
  its own file in the documentation

Fixes:

* For the moment, TpDBusPropertiesMixin raises Telepathy errors rather than
  D-Bus core errors on failure, due to fd.o #16776 in dbus-glib causing an
  assertion when DBUS_GERROR errors are raised

* TpConnectionManager no longer causes a crash if destroyed before it has
  read the .manager file (fd.o #16774, thanks to Sunil Mohan Adapa for the
  patch)

Dependencies:

* We no longer support automake 1.8.x, since even Maemo has had 1.9 for a
  while. We don't yet use any automake 1.9 features, but we will no longer
  test with 1.8 unless someone explains to me why a 4 year old version is
  still relevant :-)

telepathy-glib 0.7.11 (2008-07-02)
==================================

The "design is hard" release.

This is mainly a bugfix release.

Fixes:

* fd.o #16307: in TpConnection, don't assert when a connection goes CONNECTED
  while a GetStatus call is pending

* In TpDBusPropertiesMixin: return properly if Get, Set or GetAll are called
  on nonexistent interfaces or properties; if the wrong type is passed to Set,
  coerce it to the right type (if possible) and actually use the right type;
  and if the coercion fails, don't leak memory

* In libglibcodegen (code generation), use the right GType for arrays of
  object-path

Enhancements:

* Use Python rather than XSLT for code generation, for improved maintainability

Release notes for projects using code generation:

* All the XSLT (except doc-generator.xsl and identity.xsl) has been rewritten
  in Python. It should produce identical results, but be careful when updating!

* You must update libglibcodegen to this version if there are arrays of
  object-path in your API, otherwise it just won't work

telepathy-glib 0.7.10 (2008-06-06)
==================================

The "properties everywhere" release.

Again, this version mainly contains infrastructure to support future APIs,
like the planned Requests API.

Enhancements:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.7
  - Channel gained immutable/read-only ChannelType, TargetHandleType,
    TargetHandle and Interfaces properties

* TpGroupMixin now supports the Group properties introduced in the previous
  version

* Added an example connection manager with channel-specific handles in
  chatrooms

telepathy-glib 0.7.9 (2008-05-30)
=================================

The "scaffolding" release.

This version mostly contains infrastructure to support APIs that are coming
soon, but haven't got through the review process yet.

Enhancements:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.5
  - RoomList gained a read-only Server property
  - Text gained TP_CHANNEL_TEXT_MESSAGE_FLAG_NON_TEXT_CONTENT,
    TP_CHANNEL_TEXT_MESSAGE_TYPE_DELIVERY_REPORT to support the future
    Messages and DeliveryReporting interfaces

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.6
  - Group properties (but the group mixin does not yet implement them)
  - Group HandleOwnersChanged, SelfHandleChanged
  - TP_HASH_TYPE_CHANNEL_OWNER_MAP

* New functions tp_asv_get_uint32() etc. to make it easier to use a{sv}
  hash tables (implemented in dbus-glib as a GHashTable of gchar * => GValue *)

* Enhance TpDBusPropertiesMixin so that mixins can provide properties more
  easily

* Start porting the remaining XSLT to Python for better maintainability

Fixes:

* TpProxy: Avoid a misleading debug message every time a pending call
  completes, and probably fix detection of crashing services

* tp_dbus_check_valid_interface_name: correctly detect that a name with a
  dot followed by a digit is invalid

* Add a Valgrind suppression for SELinux-related ld.so initialization (not our
  problem)

Release notes for projects using code-generation:

* When you update tools copied from telepathy-glib, be aware that
  libglibcodegen.py now depends on libtpcodegen.py, and that some of the
  formerly-XSLT tools have been replaced by Python versions

telepathy-glib 0.7.8 (2008-05-09)
=================================

The "Hold, unheld" release

Enhancements:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.4
  - add Hold API to code-generation

Fixes:

* Make coding-style check less fragile

Recommended updates for projects using check-coding-style.mk:

* Update check-coding-style.mk

* In every Makefile where check-coding-style.mk is used, make check-local
  depend on check-coding-style (this is no longer done automatically)

telepathy-glib 0.7.7 (2008-05-02)
=================================

The "Old Trip" release.

API changes:

* It is an error to pass non-NULL user_data, weak_object or destroy arguments
  when making an asynchronous method call with callback == NULL (i.e.
  ignoring the reply) - doing this would make no sense

Enhancements:

* Implement tp_connection_call_when_ready, tp_channel_call_when_ready -
  fully async variants of the existing run_when_ready API (fd.o #15300)

* Documentation: divide up the service-side Channel interfaces by topic,
  in the same way the client-side ones were already divided up

* TpTextMixin: drop the futile attempt to limit memory consumption. We were
  doing it wrong, and a typical connection manager has so many ways it can
  be induced to consume memory that trying to guard against this particular
  case by truncating or dropping messages seems likely to cause more problems
  than it fixes.

* TpTextMixin: save a malloc/free cycle in GetMessageTypes

* TpGroupMixin: don't emit GroupFlagsChanged(0, 0)

* Log a message when disconnected from the D-Bus session bus

* Improve ABI-checking functionality so symbols only have to be whitelisted
  just before a release

Fixes:

* TpBaseConnection: don't return from Disconnect() until disconnection has
  fully completed (fd.o #15796)

* libglibcodegen.py: generate correct bindings for arrays of object-path (ao)

* glib-client-gen.py: cope correctly with Unicode in the spec

* doc-generator.xsl: update from telepathy-spec to cope with arrays of mappings

* When a channel's connection becomes invalidated, don't warn if the
  resulting invalidation causes the channel to be freed (fd.o #15644)

* In tp_handle_lookup() on a dynamic handle repository, if the ID is valid
  but there is no handle, raise the error NotAvailable, instead of returning
  0 with no error set (fd.o #15387)

* When asynchronous method calls are made on an unsupported interface, call
  the user-supplied destroy() callback on the user_data (fd.o #15530)

* TpTextMixin: fix a memory leak in ListPendingMessages

* Use automake 1.8 if available, to verify that we can still build on such
  an old version

* When running under valgrind with the recommended suppressions, don't
  complain about libc dlopen initialization caused by the handle-leak debug
  code

Recommended updates for projects using code-generation:

* Update libglibcodegen.py to avoid a crash if arrays of object-path appear
  in your API in future

* Update glib-client-gen.py to avoid fd.o #15530; this will cause your project
  to require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.3

telepathy-glib 0.7.6 (2008-04-03)
=================================

The "hold the assertions" release.

API changes:

* API was added to fix fd.o #15325. Projects that add extension interfaces
  to TpChannel or TpConnection might suffer from assertion failures if those
  interfaces are later added to telepathy-glib, unless they follow the
  recommendations below. Projects that do not use the telepathy-glib code
  generation tools are unaffected.

* Related to the above, extending TpDBusDaemon, TpMediaStreamHandler,
  TpMediaSessionHandler and TpConnectionManager is officially not supported
  at this time.

Enhancements:

* Updated to specification 0.17.3
  - supports the CallState interface, for receiving notifications of a
    remote contact or device's state (currently supported states are: ringing,
    queued, placed us on hold)
  - MediaStreamHandler supports some new Hold-related API
  - the Hold interface is *not* yet supported, use private code-generation
    (as seen in telepathy-sofiasip) for now

Fixes:

* Doesn't assert in client code when a connection's GetInterfaces method fails
  (fd.o #15306)

* The build process works on platforms without -Wl,-O1 and
  -Wl,--version-script, such as Mac OS X (fd.o #15026)

* test-handle-set now runs under a temporary session bus, so the tests can work
  in platforms without working D-Bus autolaunch

* Code generation uses G_GNUC_UNUSED where necessary, so you can use the
  generated code in projects with stricter warning flags than telepathy-glib
  itself

* A couple of unterminated argument lists when initializing the allowed
  message types for the text mixin have been fixed

* glib-client-gen.py optionally inserts a guard against assertion failures
  caused by a local extension overriding an interface that is also now provided
  by telepathy-glib (fd.o #15325)

* glib-client-gen.py has a mechanism to allow its output to be made
  backwards-compatible: specify --tp-proxy-api=x.y.z where x.y.z is the oldest
  version of telepathy-glib you check for in configure.ac (it must be at
  least 0.7.6)

Recommended updates for projects using telepathy-glib code generation:

* Update glib-client-gen.py from telepathy-glib, and invoke it with
  the extra argument "--tp-proxy-api=0.7.6", to fix #15325 (this will make
  the generated code require telepathy-glib 0.7.6)

* Before calling tp_proxy_or_subclass_hook_on_interface_add for an existing
  class, call tp_proxy_init_known_interfaces,
  tp_connection_init_known_interfaces or tp_channel_init_known_interfaces.

telepathy-glib 0.7.5 (2008-03-07)
=================================

Enhancements:

* Updated to specification 0.17.2
  - GType-generating functions for Media_Session_Handler_Info
  - Added TP_CONN_MGR_PARAM_FLAG_SECRET

Fixes:

* No longer crashes if a proxy is invalidated while still invoking signal
  callbacks (fd.o #14854)

* Compilation now works on architectures with function descriptors, like ppc64
  (fd.o #14852, thanks Brian Pepple)

* TpChannel no longer crashes if GetInterfaces() returns an error or an
  empty list (fd.o #14855)

* Linking examples no longer fails in environments where .la files exist for
  system libraries

telepathy-glib 0.7.4 (2008-03-04)
=================================

Fixes:

* Refactoring and life-cycle fixes in TpProxy, including some assertions
  during method-call and signal-connection cancellation (fd.o #14750; fixes a
  crash in development versions of Mission Control)

* Maps "_" back to "-" in protocol names seen in bus names (fd.o #14667;
  fixes telepathy-inspector 0.5.1 not displaying Salut connections)

* Does not leak the GError when connecting to signals on an unsupported
  interface (fd.o #14746)

* Builds with more warnings by default, for additional strictness

* Improvements to example client code:
  - make example_cli_init() safe to call multiple times
  - generate signals-marshal.list in a way that avoids more gcc warnings

Recommended updates for projects using telepathy-glib code generation:

* Update glib-client-gen.py from telepathy-glib to fix #14746 (this will make
  the generated code require telepathy-glib 0.7.3)
* Consider updating *_cli_init() and extensions/Makefile.am to resemble the
  examples

telepathy-glib 0.7.3 (2008-02-20)
=================================

Requirements:

* pkg-config 0.21 is now required

* gtkdoc 1.8 is recommended

Enhancements:

* Supports org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties with a mixin for services, and
  extensions to auto-generated code

Fixes:

* Fixed a crash that could occur when pending calls on otherwise unreferenced
  proxies are cancelled, e.g. during teardown in telepathy-stream-engine
  (fd.o #14576)

* Correct client-side bindings are generated for methods that return a variant
  (e.g. o.fd.DBus.Properties.Get) fixing potential crashes in clients

* tp_dbus_check_valid_object_path allows "/" and disallows "//", not the
  reverse

* Partially works around some gtkdoc 1.7 bugs (if your gtkdoc is 1.7 you'll
  still lose the "Telepathy protocol enumerations" section)

* Uses pkg-config's Requires.private feature to reduce shared library
  interdependencies

telepathy-glib 0.7.2 (2008-02-11)
=================================

* Fixed incorrect GValue code that caused Empathy to assert on
  Room -> Join New...

* Added support for the D-Bus core Properties, Introspect and Peer interfaces

telepathy-glib 0.7.1 (2008-01-04)
=================================

This is a major feature release, adding client-side code which continues the
process of making libtelepathy obsolete.

* Implements specification 0.17.1
  - it is a fatal error for TpBaseConnectionManagerClass::cm_dbus_name not to
    conform to the specification (briefly: it must match
    /[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]+/)
  - connections cannot be opened for protocols not matching
    /[A-Za-z-][A-Za-z0-9-]+/

* Initial client-side code added:
  - TpProxy, a much more capable version of DBusGProxy (it more closely
    resembles a dbus-python ProxyObject, with one object per connection,
    channel etc. rather than one per interface)
  - auto-generation machinery for client call wrappers (namespaced tp_cli_*)
  - TpDBusDaemon, a TpProxy subclass to talk to the bus daemon
  - TpChannel, a channel (replaces libtelepathy's TpChan)
  - TpConnection, a connection (replaces libtelepathy's TpConn)
  - TpConnectionManager, a connection manager (replaces libtelepathy's
    TpConnMgr)
  - TpMediaStreamHandler and TpMediaSessionHandler, media signalling helpers
  - Correct algorithms for listing connection managers, listing connections,
    and reading .manager files (as documented in the 0.17.1 spec)

* Examples extended:
  - various simple client examples
  - an "echo" connection manager
  - an extended connection manager and client (implementing a hypothetical
    Hats interface), to illustrate how to support experimental or extension
    interfaces in services and clients

* Miscellaneous:
  - tp_debug_divert_messages (adapted from Gabble)
  - tp_debug_timestamped_log_handler (adapted from Gabble)
  - tp_cm_param_setter_offset now supports byte-array params

* Versioned symbols
  - versions are of the form TELEPATHY_GLIB_x.y.z
  - unreleased development builds use versions containing _UNRELEASED
    to force relinking against a proper version

telepathy-glib 0.7.0 (2007-11-22)
=================================

This is the first release from the 0.7.0 development branch, and
prepares the way for the client-side code I'm going to be merging soon.

* Enums etc. updated to specification 0.17.0
* Improved support for connection managers whose parameters aren't known
  at compile time (*coughhazecough* :-)
* Build system refactoring to make it less weird
* GType-generating functions and macros in gtypes.h cache the results of calls
  to dbus-glib type lookup functions, and give data types convenient names
* Functions and macros to generate GQuarks for interface names (which will
  be used extensively by client code in future)
* The beginning of an examples/ directory, containing the simplest possible
  example connection manager (it doesn't support any protocols)
* Dependencies increased to libdbus 0.93, dbus-glib 0.73, glib 2.10
