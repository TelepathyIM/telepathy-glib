telepathy-logger 0.6.0 (2012-10-29)
===================================

This is the start of a new stable branch.

There was never a development release in the 0.5 series so there are
no changes there. Here is the summary of particularly noteworthy
changes since 0.4:

• telepathy-glib 0.19.2 is now required and deprecated telepathy-glib
  usage has been removed.

• Multiple introspection problems have been fixed. (fd.o#50361)

• Streamed Media channel support has been removed.

telepathy-logger 0.4.0 (2012-04-03)
===================================

This is the start of a new stable branch.

There are no changes since 0.2.13.

For details of the changes since the last stable branch, please look
at the git log, the list is just too long.

telepathy-logger 0.2.13 (2012-04-03)
===================================

The "Empathy really, really needs this" release

This release ports the Call support in the logger to Call1. Since Call1 is in
telepathy-glib, this is no longer a build option, and something we always
support.

Major changes:

* Support Call1 (Nicolas Dufresne)

telepathy-logger 0.2.12 (2011-11-01)
===================================

The "Oops" release

This bug fix release correct the accidental so-name bump. Distributions
should use this release instead of 0.2.11.


telepathy-logger 0.2.11 (2011-10-31)
===================================

The "Halloween" release

This is a bug fix release. Distributions are encouraged to update.

Fixes:

* Fix crash caused by used after free (Nicolas Dufresne)
* Fix crash wen call sender or actor is not set (Vincent Penquerc'h)
* Fix missing alias feature when receiving messages (Nicolas Dufresne)
* Remove use of deprecated g_thread_init() (Nicolas Dufresne)
* Improve silent build rulesa (Nicolas Dufresne)
* Improve introspection annotation (Nicolas Dufresne)


telepathy-logger 0.2.10 (2011-05-26)
===================================

The "Malade!" release

This release add support for text edits along with bug fixes. Distributions
are encouraged to update.

Fixes:

* Add support for text message edits (David Laban)
* Fix events ordering and merging speed (Nicolas Dufresne)
* Fix destroy function for get_entities_async (Emilio Pozuelo Monfort)
* Fix crash in pidgin log store (Guillaume Desmottes)


telepathy-logger 0.2.9 (2011-05-06)
===================================

The "Vendredi au soleil" release

This bug fix release most importantly fixes performance issues. This has been
possible through the rework of Call logs storage method. Note that older Call
logs will not be retrieved from store. We tolerate this breakage for two
reasons, Call support is still experimental and a bug in the .client file was
causing call logs not to be forwarded to the observer. Distributions are
encourage to update as this release improves performance when opening chat
windows in Empathy.

Fixes:

* Work around GLib TimeZone cache bug (Gnome bug #646435)
* Fix client file to effectively observe Call.DRAFT channels
* Downgraded autotools requirement to 2.65
* Fix SQL syntax error and pending message order
* Store Calls log in seperate file (e.g 20110505.call.log)
* Make Pidgin store robust to empty file
* And more unit tests


telepathy-logger 0.2.8 (2011-03-31)
===================================

The "Piquez moi quelqu'un" release

This release fixes wrong libtelepathy-logger shared object version. This
error was introduced in version 0.2.7, where age has been incremented but
not the current. Distribution should update to this version to avoid
libtelepathy-logger shared object version to go backward.

Fixes:

* Fixed wrong shared object version.


telepathy-logger 0.2.7 (2011-03-25)
===================================

The "TGIF" release

This release adds experimental support for call logging, bug fixes and
optimisations. We suggest distributions to update to this version. Note
that compilation option '--enable-call' is required to use experimental
call support.

Fixes:

* Readd AM_PATH_PYTHON back to configure.ac, required for codegen
* Add support for call logging
* Search using GRegex to prevent matching XML tags
* Improve test coverage
* Avoid using g_list_append() for performance reason
* Fixed infinit loop in pending message cache logic


telepathy-logger 0.2.6 (2011-03-22)
===================================

The "Slimmer" release

This rework release reimplement text observer on top of Telepathy GLib class
and reimplement pending message cache. The deprecated Channel.Type.Text API
support are no longer used. Distributions are encourage to update as this
release fixes issues with handling of delivery reports.

Fixes:

* Ported all internal time manipulation to GDateTime
* Observers now cache TplEntity object instead of TpContact to reduce number
  memory allocations
* Removed generated log_id
* Removed unused twisted test framework
* Port observer to TpTextChannel
* Reimplemnent pending message cache
* Update Telepathy GLib requirement to 0.14.0

telepathy-logger 0.2.5 (2011-03-03)

suggest distributions to update to this version.

Fixes:

* Fix another 32 vs 64bits bug (Emilio)


telepathy-logger 0.2.4 (2011-03-01)

* Make the introspection files be 0.2 instead of 1.0 (Emilio)
* Fix use of uninitialised variable (Nicolas)
* Remove reference to Gnome in configure.ac (Nicolas)
* Remove GPL warning in README, Logger is now fully LGPL (Nicolas)
* Move observer and SQlite tests with dbus enabled tests (Nicolas)
* Update valgrind suppressions. (Nicolas)
* Fix XML store test crash on 32bit computer. (Nicolas)


telepathy-logger 0.2.3 (2011-02-28)
===================================

The "I hate mondays" release

This bug fix release fixes potential crash on 32bit machines. We
strongly suggest distributions to update to this version.

Fixes:

* Convert timestamp from uint to int64 on sent message (Nicolas)
* Set an error if text event body is empty or NULL (fd.o#31121, Emilio)


telepathy-logger 0.2.2 (2011-02-28)

The "Monday morning" release

This bug fix release fixes issues around TplEvent with room target.
It also contains initial work for GIntrospection.

Fixes:

* Start work on introspection support (Jasper and Emilio)
* Fix TplEvent::get_target() logic so room event are stored correctly (Nicolas)
* Fix room check when XML log store reads events (Nicolas)
* Free GDate with g_date_free() instead of g_free ()
* Fix log_store_xml_get_filtered_events() to return no more than num_events (Nicolas)

strongly suggest distributions using 0.2.0 version to update to this
version.

Fixes:

* Use g_list_alloc() instead of g_new0() to allocate list (Sjoerd)
* Use _async() TplLogManager methods in unit tests (Nicolas)
* Do not ignore system() return value in unit tests (Guillaume)


telepathy-logger 0.2.0 (2011-02-23)
===================================

This version is a large API refactoring that enables abstraction of
the logged event type and clarifies the methods. Alongside this large refactoring
some new features like ability to clear logs (see D-Bus API) and read-only
Pidgin log store can be found. While it remains compatible on the storage
side, the API is not.A version of Empathy compatible with this release will be
released shortly; watch the Telepathy mailing list for details.

Enhancement:

* Read-only support for Pidgin log store.
* Ability to clear logs (see D-Bus API).
* Largely reworked API:
  - TplEntry is now TplEvent.
  - Sub-class naming is now more natural (e.g. TplTextEvent instead of
    TplEventText).
  - D-Bus API has been reduced to the minimum required function.
  - chat-id is now commonly called target-id to abstract text chat.
  - TplSearchHit has been cleanup and usage reduced.
  - TplEntityDirection has been remove from TplEntity.
  - TplEntity and TplEvent class was cleaned from useless setters and unused getters.
  - ROOM is now used instead of GROUP to follow Telepathy naming.
  - _get_chats() method is now replaced by _get_entities().
  - Unused method _search_in_identitifer() is removed.
  - TplTextEvent exposes message-type to let client know if it's a /me message.
  - TplLogManager API now takes TplEntity to identify target.
  - TplEventTypeMask can be used to filter event type (for future use).
* A fair amount of test has been added.


telepathy-logger 0.1.7 (2010-11-29)
===================================

This bug fix release fixes a crash and remove a lot of memory leaks. We
strongly suggest to distributions to update to this version.

Fixes:

• Stop using tp_get_bus(). (smcv)
• Loads of memory leaks fixed. (cassidy)
• Don't crash by trying to use the sqlite log store after it has been
  disposed. (cassidy)

telepathy-logger 0.1.6 (2010-10-13)
===================================

The “maths lesson” release.

Fixes:

• Running the test suite no longer accesses your session's GSettings.
  (Danni)
• Out-of-tree builds now work. (Nicolas)
• A CM crashing with open text channels no longer causes conversations
  not to be logged, and to take 25 seconds to be displayed.
  (fd.o#30824, Will)

telepathy-logger 0.1.5 (2010-08-11)
===================================

Dependencies:

* GLib ≥ 2.25.11
* No more dependency on GConf

Enhancements:

* The logger uses GSettings instead of GConf for preferences (fdo #28602). The
  ignore-accounts key has been removed for now as it was unused and broken.

Fix:

* Make sure that TplLogSearchHit always contains the account if
  known (fdo #29058).

telepathy-logger 0.1.4 (2010-07-08)
===================================

Fix:

* Don't crash if the logger is asked to observe the same channel twice. This
  appens with telepathy-idle because of bug fdo #28918.

telepathy-logger 0.1.3 (2010-06-28)
===================================

Dependencies:

* telepathy-glib ≥ 0.11.7

Enhancements:

* Properly support the Debug interface.

* Reuse existing TpAccount objects instead of creating new ones. This reduce
  the D-Bus traffic when logging messages as we don't need to fetch the
  account properties any more (fdo #28682).

* Cache all the participants of the room when logging group text channels
  (fdo #28680).

Fixes:

* Correctly set the 'isuser' flag when logging text channels.

* Correctly set the sender ID when logging group text channels.

* Properly sort dates in the list returned by
  tpl_log_manager_get_filtered_messages_finish.

* Fix a race when logging text messages.

* Correctly set the default value of the ignorelist gconf key.

* Install the logger to $libexec.

* Set the Recover flag in the logger's client file so MissionControl will
  make it observe existing channels when (re)starting.

* Return earlier from ObserveChannels() to avoid blocking channels dispatching
  too long (fdo #28787).


telepathy-logger 0.1.2 (2010-06-18)
===================================

The API of libtelepathy-logger has been cleaned up and now only includes:
- TplEntity (previously TplContact)
- TplEntry (previously TplLogEntry)
- TplEntryText (previously TplLogTextEntry)
- TplLogManager

This API should stay stable in the 0.1.x cycle.

The library has been licensed more permissively and is now available under the
GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or (at your option) any
later version.

Dependencies:

* telepathy-glib ≥ 0.11.5
* telepathy-mission-control ≥ 5.4.0 is recommended


telepathy-logger 0.1.1 (2010-02-26)
===================================

The ``brick by brick'' release.

This is the second previous release of the telepathy-logger. You should be aware
that this is a piece of software that is still very much in development,
everything is subject to change.

The idea behind tp-logger is that it will become a generic logging daemon usable
anywhere in Telepathy, with any Telepathy client.

Changes in this release:
 - libtelepathy-logger.pc is now just telepathy-logger.pc
 - asynchronous API has _finish() methods.
 - Fix a crasher in handling MUCs
 - Logger now observes channels that are open when it starts
 - API now includes support for storing favourite contacts in a way that can
   be shared between Telepathy clients

telepathy-logger 0.1.0 (2010-02-24)
===================================

The ``Calamity Ensues'' release

This is the first preview release of the telepathy-logger. You should be aware
that this is a piece of software that is still very much in development,
everything is subject to change.

The idea behind tp-logger is that it will become a generic logging daemon usable
anywhere in Telepathy, with any Telepathy client.

Things that mostly work:

 - logging of text channels into an Empathy style log format using a Telepathy
   Observer client
 - Telepathy-style D-Bus API to retrieve logs (will be extended soon with more
   functionality)
 - libtelepathy-logger API to allow clients to access logs en-masse
 - GConf preferences to control what accounts to log

Things that don't work:

 - existing channels won't be logged when the logger starts
 - preference changes aren't noticed asynchronously

Note that tp-logger won't import your existing logs from Empathy, for the time
being, if you're running it, you are going to end up with two sets of logs,
one from Empathy and one from tp-logger.
