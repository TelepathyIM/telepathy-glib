telepathy-glib examples
=======================

You can get more examples of telepathy-glib usage from:
* the telepathy-glib branch of telepathy-inspector (versions >= 0.5.1 will use
  telepathy-glib)
* the core connection managers (particularly telepathy-gabble; also
  telepathy-salut, telepathy-sofiasip and telepathy-haze)
* the regression tests (tests/ in the source release)

telepathy-glib-examples.supp
----------------------------
A Valgrind suppressions file, used to check the examples and tests for leaks -
it may be useful to Telepathy developers, to suppress unwanted messages
when debugging other Telepathy components.

client/list-managers.c
----------------------
List available connection managers.
Usage: telepathy-example-list-managers

client/inspect-cm.c
-------------------
Introspect a connection manager (doesn't yet print out the information
gathered, but it could).
Example usage: telepathy-example-inspect-cm gabble

client/list-connections.c
-------------------------
List available connections.
Usage: telepathy-example-list-connections

client/inspect-connection.c
---------------------------
Introspect a connection (as found by list-connections) and make an asynchronous
method call to list its channels.
Usage: one of
  telepathy-example-inspect-connection BUS_NAME
  telepathy-example-inspect-connection OBJECT_PATH
  telepathy-example-inspect-connection BUS_NAME OBJECT_PATH

client/inspect-channel.c
------------------------
Introspect a channel (as found by inspect-connection) and print out its
type, handle and interfaces. If it has the Group interface, also make a
reentrant method call to list its members.
Usage: telepathy-example-inspect-channel CONN_OBJECT_PATH CHAN_OBJECT_PATH

cm/no-protocols/
----------------
The simplest possible Telepathy connection manager. It doesn't support any
protocols.

cm/echo/
--------
A simple fake Telepathy connection manager, which supports text channels where
the remote contact just echoes back your messages.

extensions/
-----------
An example of how to add extra interfaces to telepathy-glib, for use with
experimental or special-purpose interfaces. client/extended-client.c and
cm/extended/ use the convenience library built by extensions/ to implement
the Hats interface.
