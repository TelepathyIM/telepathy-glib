/**
 * SECTION:base-channel
 * @title: TpBaseChannel
 * @short_description: base class for all channel implementations
 * @see_also: #TpSvcChannel
 *
 * This base class makes it easier to write channel
 * implementations by implementing some of its properties, and defining other
 * relevant properties.
 *
 * Subclasses should fill in #TpBaseChannelClass.channel_type and
 * #TpBaseChannelClass.target_entity_type; and implement the
 * #TpBaseChannelClass.close virtual functions.
 *
 * If the channel type and/or interfaces being implemented define immutable
 * D-Bus properties besides those on the Channel interface, the subclass should
 * implement the #TpBaseChannelClass.fill_immutable_properties virtual function.
 *
 * If the #TpBaseChannel:object-path property is not set at construct
 * time, the #TpBaseChannelClass.get_object_path_suffix virtual function will
 * be called to determine the channel's path, whose default implementation
 * simply generates a unique path based on the object's address in memory.
 *
 * #TpBaseChannel also has the ability to remove the channel from the
 * bus, but keep the object around. To close the channel and remove it
 * from the bus, subclasses should call
 * tp_base_channel_disappear(). To bring the channel back, subclasses
 * use tp_base_channel_reopened_with_requested() and the channel
 * should be re-announced with
 * tp_channel_manager_emit_new_channel(). Note that channels which can
 * disappear but can also reopen due to pending messages need special
 * casing by the channel manager:
 *
 * |[
 * static void
 * channel_closed_cb (TpBaseChannel *chan,
 *     TpChannelManager *manager)
 * {
 *   MyChannelManager *self = MY_CHANNEL_MANAGER (manager);
 *   TpHandle handle = tp_base_channel_get_target_handle (chan);
 *
 *   // first, emit ChannelClosed if the channel is registered (it
 *   // won't be registered if it is appearing from being hidden, so
 *   // let's not emit the signal in this case)
 *   if (tp_base_channel_is_registered (chan))
 *     {
 *       tp_channel_manager_emit_channel_closed (manager,
 *           TP_BASE_CHANNEL (chan));
 *     }
 *
 *   if (tp_base_channel_is_destroyed (chan))
 *     {
 *       // destroyed() must have been called; forget this channel
 *       g_hash_table_remove (self->priv->channels, handle);
 *     }
 *   else if (tp_base_channel_is_respawning (chan))
 *     {
 *       // reopened_with_requested() must have been called; re-announce the channel
 *       tp_channel_manager_emit_new_channel (manager, TP_BASE_CHANNEL (chan));
 *     }
 *   else
 *     {
 *       // disappear() must have been called, do nothing special
 *     }
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * and the #TpChannelManagerIface.foreach_channel virtual function
 * should be updated to only include registered channels:
 *
 * |[
 * static void
 * foreach_channel (TpChannelManager *manager,
 *     TpChannelManagerChannelClassFunc func,
 *     gpointer user_data)
 * {
 *   MyChannelManager *self = MY_CHANNEL_MANAGER (manager);
 *   GHashTableIter iter;
 *   gpointer chan;
 *
 *   g_hash_table_iter_init (&iter, self->priv->channels);
 *   while (g_hash_table_iter_next (&iter, NULL, &chan))
 *     {
 *       if (tp_base_channel_is_registered (TP_BASE_CHANNEL (chan)))
 *         func (TP_BASE_CHANNEL (chan), user_data);
 *     }
 * }
 * ]|

 * this type
 * @close: A virtual function called to close the channel, which will be called
 *  by tp_base_channel_close() and by the implementation of the Closed D-Bus
 *  method.
 * @fill_immutable_properties: A virtual function called to add custom
 * properties to the DBus properties hash.  Implementations must chain up to the
 * parent class implementation and call
 * tp_dbus_properties_mixin_fill_properties_hash() on the supplied hash table
 * @get_object_path_suffix: Returns a string that will be appended to the

/**
 * TpBaseChannelCloseFunc:
 * @chan: a channel
 *
 * Signature of an implementation of the #TpBaseChannelClass.close virtual

 * tp_base_channel_destroyed() if the channel is really closed as a result, or
 * tp_base_channel_reopened() if the channel will be re-spawned (for instance,
 * due to unacknowledged messages on a text channel), but need not do so before
 * returning. Note that channels that support re-spawning must also implement
 * #TpSvcChannelInterfaceDestroyable.
 *
 * Implementations may assume that tp_base_channel_is_destroyed() is FALSE for
 * @chan when called.  Note that if this function is implemented
 * asynchronously, it may be called more than once. A subclass which needs to
 * perform some asynchronous clean-up in order to close might implement this
 * function as follows:
 *
 * |[
 * static void
 * my_channel_close (TpBaseChannel *chan)
 * {
 *   MyChannel *self = MY_CHANNEL (chan);
 *
 *   if (self->priv->closing)
 *     return;
 *
 *   self->priv->closing = TRUE;
 *
 *   // some hypothetical channel-specific clean-up function:
 *   clean_up (self, cleaned_up_cb);
 * }
 *
 * static void
 * cleaned_up_cb (MyChannel *self)
 * {
 *   // all done, we can finish closing now
 *   tp_base_channel_destroyed (TP_BASE_CHANNEL (self));
 * }
 * static void
 * my_channel_class_init (MyChannelClass *klass)
 * {
 *   TpBaseChannelClass *base_channel_class = TP_BASE_CHANNEL_CLASS (klass);
 *
 *   klass->close = my_channel_close;
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * If a subclass does not need to do anything to clean itself up, it may
 * implement #TpBaseChannelClass.close using tp_base_channel_destroyed()
 * directly:
 *
 * |[
 * static void
 * my_channel_class_init (MyChannelClass *klass)
 * {
 *   TpBaseChannelClass *base_channel_class = TP_BASE_CHANNEL_CLASS (klass);
 *
 *   klass->close = tp_base_channel_destroyed;

 * @chan: a channel
 * @properties: a dictionary of @chan's immutable properties, which the
 *  implementation may add to using
 *  tp_dbus_properties_mixin_fill_properties_hash()
 *
 * Signature of an implementation of the

 * virtual function. A typical implementation, for a channel implementing
