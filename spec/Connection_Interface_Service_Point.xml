    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>An interface for connections whose channels may be able to indicate
        specific they are connected to some form
        of service station.  For example, when
        dialing 9-1-1 in the US, a GSM modem/network will recognize that as
        an emergency call, and inform higher levels of the stack that the
        call is being handled by an emergency service.  In this example,
        the call is handled by a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) which is labeled
        as "urn:service:sos".  Other networks and protocols may handle this
        differently while still using this interface.</p>

          A list of IDs that are mapped to this service. This is provided as
          a convenience for the UIs, but the preferred method for
          requesting channel to a service is by setting <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Interface.ServicePoint.DRAFT">InitialServicePoint</tp:dbus-ref>
